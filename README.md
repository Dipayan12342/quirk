**Quirk is no longer being maintained.**

One of the biggest challenges the world is currently facing is mental health. There is a sense of anxiety, depression, and uncertainty in society. Though we will inch closer to finding a solution for COVID-19, it will take longer for the fear to subside. On this World Mental Health Day, let‚Äôs take a step back and shift our awareness on these six crucial aspects of mental well-being.

Gurudev calls this the ‚Äòart of living‚Äô where people are taught about the interlinking between life, breath, and emotions. It is important that we learn and teach our children, and families about consciousness, and the different tendencies of the mind. We need to educate our people to be happy with themselves and friendly with others and wean from the complex psychological gymnastics of the mind. If we are unhappy, we can never be friendly; and if we are unfriendly, we can never be happy.

Do you know there is a state of the mind that gives us a deeper rest than even sleep? We are generally aware of the three states of consciousness ‚Äì waking, dreaming, and sleeping.

There is some activity as our body recuperates and grows in sleep. It is the fourth state, which is devoid of activity which results in very low metabolism. Through meditation, it is possible to go deeper into this fourth state and get the deepest rest.

The mind is like a slate. When we keep writing on the slate, again and again, without erasing, nothing is legible. Our mind becomes like that when we are unable to let go and cleanse it. We all have memories but when we are stuck with one memory that is called trauma.

Yoga leads to a cessation of the modulations of the mind. ‚ÄúDrashtuh swarupe avasthanam‚Äù ‚Äì with the practice of yoga, one abides in one‚Äôs true nature (consciousness), the seer. A person becomes miserable when the seer and scenery are confused. Yoga helps in developing discrimination (viveka) ‚Äì a much-needed tool in everyday living. Through a deeper and more holistic understanding of life, living becomes more effortless.

We have four inner faculties of consciousness ‚Äì mind, memory, intellect, ego, or the sense of awareness that ‚ÄòI am‚Äô. Being aware of these inner faculties makes an individual more mindful of his/her actions.

Consciousness is a bridge between the heart and the mind. While science is the matter of the head, art is the matter of the heart. Combining these two extremities of our consciousness ‚Äì science, and art ‚Äì helps us live a fuller and happier life. Art is an outlet for our emotions, even for those emotions which are stuck and not expressed properly. Art ‚Äì be it painting or music or dance ‚Äì all help to regain the natural balance in life.

Hopelessness and anxiety are gone

I was ridden by deep depression and anxiety all my life. After applying your method in 2011, the symptoms started to leave. No endless ruminations anymore. Hopelessness and anxiety are pretty much gone. I'm still lacking in drive and energy, but more interested in things to enjoy and in practical matters rather than worrying about it. I just used the core method, the Looking, though. The Self-Directed Attention Exercise had proved too hard for me yet. Both techniques are described in the book in great detail, clearly referring to a lot of real-world experience working with people. There's no beating around the bush. You get to know what to do right off the bat. Every line brims with dedication, spirit of research and enthusiasm about this work. It touched my heart.

This has worked when nothing else has!

If you're looking to find inner peace and a life that's satisfying, this is THE BOOK TO BUY!! What it does: Gives simple instructions to a simple action that anyone can do! What the results are if you follow the directions: A mind that no longer has the voices telling you that "Life sucks" or "I'm not good enough " All those things that mind does will be seen as just noise! Noise that you can starve out by the power of your attention or lack placement of attention on said noise! Personal experience: As I've worked with the instructions in this book I can honestly say that my mind is a quiet friendly place for the 1st time in 58 years! And now I love my life! Which for me is a total 180 degree turn around! I cannot recommend this book highly enough!!

Great little instruction booklet on being human
I enjoyed reading this very practical and pleasantly short guide on a practice that has the potential to transform anyone‚Äôs life. John and Carla's take on self-enquiry is unique and legit. Their use of a meditation technique to aid focus and daily attention is also useful.

Can change your life by taking away your suffering

I've been involved in the seeking and spiritual healing fields all my life. I've experienced very few things that make a practical difference in one‚Äôs day to day life. For a number of years I was involved with the healer Bruno Groening and one of this main groups devoted to his teaching. Bruno was the most prolific healer I know of in recorded history. I feel the JOL teaching is an evolution of sorts to his teaching. But all spiritual belief paradigms are stripped away with JOL, and you just get a very pure teaching which can actually reduce your suffering in your life. The idea is that you can lose what John and Carla call 'the fear of life' and you can get to the point where you are not suffering no matter what happens. That doesn't mean you don't feel pain, or cry when you lose a loved one, etc. There is a simple (but not easy!) exercise called the 'Self-Directed Attention Exercise' which is the same vehicle as Buddhist anapanasati meditation, but with a different intention‚Äîand, imo, this makes all the difference. (If you are a meditator, check out John Sherman's conversation 9 on youtube where he explains the difference between the two). I've never experienced any method/teaching that is making such a practical difference in my life in terms of reducing any suffering that arises. I've been practicing this teaching for around 10 months now. I didn't want to write a review until I felt I was starting to experience consistent results in my life on a day to day basis. Now this is starting to happen for me. I highly recommend checking out John and Carla's website at justonelook.org and checking out all the videos of talks given by John Sherman on youtube. There is also a forum on the justonelook website where people discuss their experiences using this teaching, and I am keeping a record on there of any significant changes I experience as I continue to use this teaching.

Everyone should read this book!

If you're tired of the constant frustrations of life, if you've been searching for years in religion, spiritual teachings, psychology, or self-help books, but haven‚Äôt found any lasting answers, this little book is what you need. You won't need another one. John and Carla Sherman offer a detailed description of their Just one Look Method, and a clear explanation of the fundamental, underlying cause of human suffering. The solution almost seems too simple to be true, but I can vouch for the fact that it works. Although I've only been practicing this method for around nine months, I have seen significant changes in my life. My old, neurotic thinking patterns are constantly being overhauled, and I feel as though I'm finally approaching a level of maturity and sanity that was unknown to me before. I‚Äôd advise everyone to buy this book and try the Just one Look method. You've got nothing to lose, and more to gain than you can imagine.

The DIY Guide to Freedom from the Fear of Life

Jazzrascal's review says it all. IMHO this is THE guide to ending a lifetime of suffering and searching. Buy it, read it, DO WHAT IT SAYS. Jazzrascal has, I have, others have and it works. All I might add is to urge you to not just read it but do it. And, Amazon Australia, please make it available in Oz in paperback, too.


Losing a loved one, getting fired from a job, going through a divorce, and other difficult situations can lead a person to feel sad, lonely and scared. These feelings are normal reactions to life's stressors. Most people feel low and sad at times. However, in the case of individuals who are diagnosed with depression as a psychiatric disorder, the manifestations of the low mood are much more severe and they tend to persist.

Depression occurs more often in women than men. Some differences in the manner in which the depressed mood manifests have been found based on sex and age. In men it manifests often as tiredness, irritability and anger. They may show more reckless behavior and abuse drugs and alcohol. They also tend to not recognize that they are depressed and fail to seek help. In women depression tends to manifest as sadness, worthlessness, and guilt. In younger children depression is more likely to manifest as school refusal, anxiety when separated from parents, and worry about parents dying. Depressed teenagers tend to be irritable, sulky, and get into trouble in school. They also frequently have co-morbid anxiety, eating disorders, or substance abuse. In older adults depression may manifest more subtly as they tend to be less likely to admit to feelings of sadness or grief and medical illnesses which are more common in this population also contributes or causes the depression.
